This algorithm implements the Insertion Sort technique, which is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
It iterates over the input array, gradually expanding a sorted portion of the array at the beginning.

Description:
Insertion Sort works by iterating through the array from the second element to the last, and for each element, 
it finds the correct position within the sorted portion of the array and inserts it there. This process repeats until the entire array is sorted.
